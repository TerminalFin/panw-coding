Palo Alto Networks Firewall (Strata) Firewall Upgrade Tool
By Josh Levine
Systems Engineer - Army/USSOCOM

--- Same script as the original but intended to minimize module dependencies ---
--- This script is dependent upon the packaging module for version checking ---

This script automates the process of upgrading a Palo Alto Networks (Strata) firewall. The script prompts for two sets of credentials:

1. User with XML API permissions - Used to retrieve user API keys, a list of available PAN-OS versions, and download/install the latest content update.
2. Superuser account - Used to retrieve and install the selected PAN-OS versions

TODO

1. Check for PAN-OS prerequisities (i.e., upgrade to 9.0 before going to 9.0.7, etc.)
2. Error handling
