Palo Alto Networks Firewall (Strata) XML API Powershell Tool

These scripts are two of my first attempts at producing PowerShell alternatives to the popular panxapi.py scripts created by Kevin Steves at Palo Alto Networks.
My hope is to provide an alternative for environments that aren't permitted to use/install python.

This is a simple PowerShell script to query NTP status across a list of firewalls. The intent is to ensure NTP synchronization is enabled and standardized across an enterprise. There are two versions of this script:

ps-panw-ntpquery.ps1 - Linux/MacOS-based script to parse through ./fw_list.txt, a line-delimited list of firewall IP/FQDNs and output the status to ./fw_ntp_status.txt

ps-panw-ntpquery_win64.ps1 - Same as the original script but built for the Windows x64 platform. 
- This build is necessary due to the system-level differences in performing certificate validity checks on the PowerShell and PowerShell Core platforms.

Both scripts operate in the same fashion with the exception of how self-signed certificates are disregarded.

TODO:

1. Add argument-based options for processing firewalls (individually, csv list, dynamically through an automation tool such as XSOAR or Phantom)
2. Add the ability to change NTP configurations
3. Add the ability to force NTP resync
