Palo Alto Networks Python and Powershell Script Repository
By Josh Levine

These scripts represent projects I am working on related to various Palo Alto Networks products. Script functionalities are based on requirements encountered in the field. 

Requests for change can be submitted to me directly at jlevine AT paloaltonetworks DOT com. I offer no assurances of implementation but will do my best to work to integrate requirements into any scripts I produce.
